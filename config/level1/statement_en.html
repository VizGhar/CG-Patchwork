            Become the master of patchworking by filling your quilt canvas with patches. Be careful! Every patch costs
            you a few <strong>Buttons</strong> and it also takes some <strong>Time</strong> to sew it on your canvas.
            Those are your most valuable resources<br><br>
            This game is heavily inspired by 2 player board game <a

                This is turn based game but players do not necessarily alternate between turns. The player who is
                furthest behind on the <strong>Timeline</strong> takes his turn. This may result in a player taking
                multiple turns
                in a row before his opponent can take one. If there are both time tokens on same spot, player that
                played last move takes his turn.

                Game starts with pre-shuffled deck of <const>33</const> patches. All patches are placed on board and are visible to both players.
<br><br>

                In this league your goal is to cover as much of your quilt board with patches as possible.
                On your turn, you carry out one of the following actions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Advance and Receive Buttons using
                        <const>SKIP</const>

            This action consists of a few step:
            <ul>
                <li>Choose from the available <strong>Patches</strong> and place it on board</li>
                <li>Pay the depicted number of <strong>Buttons</strong> to the supply</li>
                <li>Move your <strong>Time</strong> token on the time board by a number of spaces as depicted on the
                    label
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            Patch can be placed anywhere on board as far as it won't cover already placed patches.

            The game ends after both time tokens reach the last point of the <strong>Timeline</strong>. If a time token
            were to move past the last space, it simply stops on the last space.
            
            <br><br>

            In this league you will score <const>1</const> point for each space covered with you patches.<br/><br/>

            The player with the higher score wins. In case of a tie, the player who got to the final time point of the time
            board first wins.
