            Become the master of patchworking by filling your quilt canvas with patches. Be careful! Every patch costs
            you a few <strong>Buttons</strong> and it also takes some <strong>Time</strong> to sew it on your canvas.
            Those are your most valuable resources<br><br>

                This is turn based game but players do not necessarily alternate between turns. The player who is
                furthest behind on the <strong>Timeline</strong> takes his turn. This may result in a player taking
                multiple turns
                in a row before his opponent can take one. If there are both time tokens on same spot, player that
                played last move takes his turn.<br><br>
                Your goal is to collect more <strong>Buttons</strong> than your opponent and to cover as much of your
                quilt board with patches as possible. Uncovered squares on quilt board will cost you 2 Buttons per piece
                at the end of game.<br><br>
                On your turn, you carry out one of the following actions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Advance and Receive Buttons using
                        <const>SKIP</const>

            Your <strong>Time</strong> token will move on the <strong>Timeline</strong> so that it occupies the space
            directly in front of your
            opponent's time token. You receive
            <const>1</const>
            <strong>Button</strong> per space your time token moves. You can do so using
