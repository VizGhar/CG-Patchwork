            Became the master of patchworking by filling your quilt canvas with patches. Be careful! Every patch costs
            you a few buttons and it also takes some time to sew it on your canvas.<br><br>
            This game is heavily inspired by 2 player board game Patchwork.

            <div class="statement-rules-content">
                This is turn based game but players do not necessarily alternate between turns. The player whose
                time token is the furthest behind on the time board takes his turn. This may result in a player taking
                multiple turns in a row before his opponent can take one. If there are both time tokens on same spot, player that played last move takes his turn.<br><br>
                Your goal is to collect more Buttons than your opponent (Button is game currency) and to cover as much of your quilt board with patches as possible. Uncovered squares on quilt board will cost you 2 Buttons per piece at the end of game.<br><br>
                On your turn, you carry out one of the following actions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Advance and Receive Buttons using <const>SKIP</const> command</li>
                    <li>Take and Place a Patch using <const>TAKE</const> command</li>

        </h1>
        <div class="statement-rules-content">
            Your time token will move on the time board so that it occupies the space directly in front of your
            opponent's time token. You receive 1 Button per space your time token moves. You can do so using
            <const>SKIP</const> command.

        <h1>
            <span>Take and Place a Patch</span>
        </h1>
        <div class="statement-rules-content">
            This action consists of a few step:
            <ul>
                <li>Choose from the three patches in front of the neutral token and place it on board</li>
                <li>Pay the depicted number of buttons to the supply</li>
                <li>Move your time token on the time board by a number of spaces as depicted on the label</li>
            </ul>
            Patches can be rotated in any way - mirrored and/or rotated right (clockwise) 0, 1, 2 or 3 times. It can be placed anywhere on board as far as it won't cover already placed patches. First player to fully cover 7x7 square of quill board will receive Special Tile (see End of the game). You can do so using <const>TAKE</const> command.

          <span>Time Board</span>
        </h1>
        <div class="statement-rules-content">
          Time Board consists of starting space and <const>53</const> game spaces. Regardless of the action you take, you always move your time token on the time board. Some spaces of the time board are marked. Whenever you move onto or past one of those spaces, resolve the corresponding event:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Special Patch</strong>: Take the special patch and place it on your quilt board. The special patches are the only way to "patch" single spaces of your quilt board. If you receive the Special Patch, you will have to resolve it in next turn.</li>
            <li><strong>Button Income</strong>: You receive a number of buttons according to the patches on your quilt board.</li>
          </ul>

          <span>End of the game</span>
        </h1>
        <div class="statement-rules-content">
          The game ends after both time tokens reach the last space of the time board. If a time token were to move past the last space, it simply stops on the last space. In case of <const>SKIP</const> action, you only receive buttons for the actual number of spaces moved.<br><br>
Determine the number of buttons you have left, adding <const>7</const> if you own Special Tile. From this score, subtract <const>2</const> points for each empty space of your quilt board.<br><br>
The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, the player who got to the final space of the time board first wins.
