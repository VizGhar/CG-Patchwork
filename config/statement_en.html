            Become the master of patchworking by filling your quilt canvas with patches. Be careful! Every patch costs
            you a few <strong>Buttons</strong> and it also takes some <strong>Time</strong> to sew it on your canvas.
            Those are your most valuable resources<br><br>

                This is turn based game but players do not necessarily alternate between turns. The player who is
                furthest behind on the <strong>Timeline</strong> takes his turn. This may result in a player taking
                multiple turns
                in a row before his opponent can take one. If there are both time tokens on same spot, player that
                played last move takes his turn.<br><br>
                Your goal is to collect more <strong>Buttons</strong> than your opponent and to cover as much of your
                quilt board with patches as possible. Uncovered squares on quilt board will cost you
                <const>2</const>
                <strong>Buttons</strong> per piece
                at the end of the game.<br><br>
                On your turn, you carry out one of the following actions:
